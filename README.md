# Exercise: constructor-1
* create a class called `House` that has 3 instance variables:
  * a string `address`
  * an int `numberOfFloors`
* define a *constructor method* for `House` that will print in console a message as soon as a `House` object is created
* define a testing class (e.g. `Tester`, `Start` or another _reasonable_ name you prefer) with a `main` method where:
  * you declare two `House` variables `house1` and `house2`
  * you create two `House` objects and assign them to the variables `house1` and `house2`
